          Welcome to our highly biased movie and show collection! Wondering why
          it's biased? Well, here's the scoop: this entire app is a clever
          cover-up designed for us creators to judge you based on our own
          personal tastes.

          As you navigate through the cards, here's how to play: swipe right if
          the movie or show catches your interest, or swipe left if it doesn't.
          If you encounter titles you haven't seen before, swipe right if you'd
          be interested in watching it, or left if it doesn't fit your personal
          taste. Base your decision on the provided description and genre.

          exploration, begin!
