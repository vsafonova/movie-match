# Movie-match website

It's a one-page application where users can swipe right for liked and left for disliked movies and series like on Tinder. The generated quote reflects preferences based on the most popular genres for both movies and series that the user liked. 
GPT chat creates a random list of suggested movies and series, utilizing the user's stored data. It also compares this data with other users in the database, seeking matches in genre preferences for both movies and series.

***To meet best practices, enhance Lighthouse's metrics, and ensure accessibility, it's crucial to address the improvement of swipe functionality along with refining the website's performance and user experience.***

## Project Brief dedicated to the React.js module
Design and develop a React application with dynamic, interactive user interfaces, and demonstrate an understanding of component state and props, including using hooks to control component behavior and fetching data from APIs.

## Criteria 
 <ul>
   <li>Use and composition of custom components.</li>
   <li>Use of useState for maintaining the state of one or more components.</li>
   <li>Use of event handlers for user interaction.</li>
   <li>UI elements that update in response to app or component state changes.</li>
   <li>Use of hooks for fetching data from an API (or backend server).</li>
   <li>Use of one or more third-party libraries(for example a routing library, UI library, CSS framework, etc.).</li>
   <li>Use of custom hooks for isolating reusable code.</li>
   <li>Use of context for maintaining app state.</li>
 </ul>

## What we did in this group work:
<ul>
  <li>Implemented a Tinder-like swiping interface for users to express their preferences on movies and series</li>
  <li>Integrated a third-party library for the swipe functionality, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.</li>
  <li>Developed a dynamic system for suggesting movies and series using React state management.</li>
  <li>Utilized GPT chat functionality to generate personalized quotes based on user preferences and liked genres.</li>
  <li>Utilized hooks for seamless data fetching from the backend server, ensuring smooth integration of content.</li>
  <li>Implemented context for efficient state management and sharing of data across components.</li>
</ul>
